# 🗳️ E-Voting System and Analysis using Blockchain

## 📘 About the Project
This project is a **secure, transparent, and blockchain-based e-voting system** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and **Solidity** smart contracts on the **Ethereum blockchain**.  

The goal is to create a modern digital voting platform that ensures:
- **Transparency** — everyone can verify the results  
- **Immutability** — once a vote is cast, it can’t be changed  
- **Security** — powered by blockchain and protected by authentication  

It also includes an **admin analytics dashboard** to monitor live elections, voter turnout, and candidate performance in real time.
